## What is Melon?

Melon is the second project of the DRIVENecosystem; it is a charity initiative that was created specifically to help women all over the world who are currently battling breast cancer. We sincerely hope they succeed. 

## What is the mission of the Melon?

Our mission is to create a cryptocurrency donation platform to assist over 2,500 women in their fight against breast cancer. Development of this application has already begun, and expect to be done by the end of this year. 

The cryptocurrency donations platform will be our primary utility case. Because it is constructed on the blockchain, every transaction will be transparent, and people will be able to see that their money is going directly to the individual they want to help. Our primary mission is to assist over 2500 women in their fight against breast cancer.

In addition, a portion of the prize-poll \(included within the lottery platform\) will be donated directly to a breast-cancer cause.

We have the ability to make a genuine difference for the larger good, rather than just for ourselves. We remind ourselves of our responsibility to make the world a better place for everyone by donating to those in need.

On each transaction, 10 percent of the built-in tokenomics is transferred into a charity wallet, from which we donate to women with breast cancer. So far, we have made six donations to people, which you can find on our [website](https://melontokenbsc.com/).

## Competitive Advantage

To avoid selling $MLN to make donations, we will build a crypto donations platform where users can donate in BTC, BNB, ETH, and BEP20 tokens. A tiny portion of each transaction will be utilized to purchase $MLN back.
